									<h1>Alec's Service<br />
									</h1>
									<p>In Loving Memory of Alec Russell<br />.</p>
								</header>
					
								<p>I would like to say a few words on behalf of the Jimbour Crew (we
									are the folk who worked along side Al and were lucky enough to be
									able to spend time with him on a daily basis whilst he was at
									Jimbour). Then I will hand over to Michael Laurence who was one of
									Al’s mentors in the flying fraternity – then I think someone from the
									gliding club has something to present to Al.
									What a beautiful soul Alec was and was so many things to many
									people – the word UNIQUE comes to mind – at most funerals of a 71
									y/o you would expect to have family and close friends – 50 people or
									so – I’m not sure of how many people are here today, but there is
									way more than 50 which of course is a tribute to Al and the kind of
									person he was.
									I remember Mum pulling me aside not long after we moved to
									Jimbour and telling me that I will be meeting a Mr Russell – he will be
									a little different than what you have been used to, but he has a heart
									of gold and you will watch your manners. And of course I met Mr
									Russell and in no time at all he became Al and part of our family and
									it has been that way till now – going on 48 yrs.
									You know Al was a fortunate man in so many ways – yes he was dealt
									an ordinary hand of cards at a young age, but he had a family that
									was able to give him the support and confidence to succeed in life,
									but equally as important he had a community that supported him.
									He was accepted by all with few questions asked and became a part
									of so many families in the community – you know what I reckon we
									were the lucky ones. Taking nothing away from Al himself – he
									worked very hard – particularly on his flying and was able to achieve
									results that most of us would only dream about.
									We have had many comments on Face book responding to Al’s
									passing – there has been literally hundreds – far too many to read

									out, but there is one that I would like to share with you. It is a text
									sent to me by a local who organizes Cocktails For A Cure at Jimbour
									and I think it sums up Al in his home environment to a tee.
									“I have just heard the terrible news of Alec’s passing, and I want to
									express my deepest condolences to you all.
									Alec was a wonderful man who had the most unique qualities. He
									brought a certain flare to Jimbour and he will be greatly missed by
									all. I know I will miss seeing him wandering around having a chat to
									everyone.
									Thinking of you all at this sad time.”
									Beer O’clock was almost a ritual when Al was home – not that he
									drank much, but he really enjoyed the comradery and interaction,
									particularly with the people he felt comfortable with – the Jimbour
									Crew. A few of us were fortunate enough to have a beer with him
									the evening before he died – how lucky are we – and that infectious
									laugh that we all became so familiar with.
									In closing – there is one thing of which I am absolutely certain – and
									that is if we all had more of Alec Russell’s traits this crazy world of
									ours would be a much better place to live in.
									It is going to take us a while to get used to the fact that Al won’t be
									joining us for smoko, lunch or Beer O’Clock.
									He is and will be missed - R.I.P. MATE.
