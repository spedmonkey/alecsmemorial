								<p>Eulogy for Alec
									<p>
									I’m Alec’s big sister, and David is his oldest little brother. Alec is our second sibling to die. It
									was so unexpected we are still coming to terms with it. As a family, we have loved and
									looked out for Alec, learned from him and recognised the unique person he was. But I want
									to acknowledge today the many people outside his family who were such an important part
									of his life.<br \>
									Nothing is more unique about Al than his goodness, gentleness and respect - and the way he
									brought this out in others. He has had more mentors and good friends than anyone I know.
									You may not know all of them because they are very diverse - and some are whole
									communities, like the congregation of this church.
									My apologies for omissions – you get your chance to speak in the hall later.
									It became obvious that Al had special needs from about 18 months. He began to withdraw
									into his own world. He didn’t speak. It took years to discover he wasn’t actually deaf.
									Medical advice at the time both here and overseas was that nothing could be done and he
									should be put in an institution.<br \>
									So my first acknowledgement is to our Dad who was determined to back his son despite the
									doctors’ advice. Al was around 18 when I first heard a doctor mention autism.
									Dad backed Cath McCarthy, who performed the miracle you see in the photo on the front of
									the order of service – an open-hearted son who knew and loved his father, and who at the
									age of 12, wrote his own future (on the back of the order of service)- and then made it come
									true. Cath McCarthy was a woman of faith, love and hope – and extraordinary gifts of
									communication and treatment. She proved the doctors wrong. They acknowledged it - but
									showed no interest in her methods of treatment. I still feel astonished and angry about that
									reaction.<br \>
									Now early intervention programs are a standard treatment - but some parents of autistic
									children still struggle to find and pay for them, even with the NDIS.
									So Al was one of the lucky ones back then, having dedicated parents with resources, a
									skilled teacher and mainstream schooling. His friends John Hegarty and Jeremy Healy were
									among his defenders in the school yard at De La Salle and have remained friends ever since.
									Dad was a flying instructor in the war. He always said Al had good hands on a plane, “gentle
									like a stockman” and encouraged Al to practice. He found Frank Woodfall who schooled Al
									to get his private pilot’s licence. This huge achievement enabled Al to have a career as the
									Russell Pastoral Company pilot, and thus a central role in the family business. He went on to
									get an instrument rating for night flying.<br \>
									Dad died when Al was just 30 and two marvellous mentors stepped in.
									The first was Dick Condon, who took over management of the family business, and became
									a devoted father-figure to Al over many years. Calm, wise and thoughtful – a very good man.
									His wife Marj was a lifelong friend to Al and his I’m so happy that family connection has
									continued with their grand-daughter Kate who is here today with her family.
									</p>
									<p>
									Al flew with Dick as the company pilot for many years. He already knew many of the
									managers from when he jackarooed after school. Robert Morrish was one of these. Al
									became close to his family and they were in regular contact for the rest of Al’s life. Dick
									Condon died many years ago now and Al has been lucky to find a wise financial/ life advisor
									and caring friend in Richard McGruther.<br \>
									Al’s second major mentor was Barry Hempel, a very experienced pilot who ran a flying
									school at Archerfield. He welcomed Al into his extended family - first Margaret, his former
									wife and business partner, and later his wife Melanie and their children Natalie and Aaron.
									Al went on regular holidays with Barry and his family including to the Philippines, north
									Queensland and central Australia. The most spectacular was when Barry included Al in a
									team of pilots to fly an Antinov from Poland. <br \>
									Barry died in a plane accident but Al remained very close to the Hempel family and watched
									Natalie and Aaron grow up, mostly through visits to Margaret Hempel. The day he died, Al
									was about to drive down to have Christmas with Margaret and her family and friends. I’m
									glad that Margaret and other members of her family could be here today.
									Dad knew members of the gliders club at McCaffreys Field from back in WW2. He
									introduced Al to them and he flew regularly for the rest of his life. I remember my earlier
									visits with Al, sitting around in the pie cart, him reaching to respond to radio messages –
									completely part of the team. <br \>
									Al’s life in the Dalby community and beyond has been a tribute both to him, and the large
									number of people who have cared for and respected him. That’s something we can be really
									proud of. It shows the goodness both of Al himself and of his community.
									There’s the Dalby congregation. First I heard from Al was about the men’s group at the
									church. I did not get any details of that secret men’s business - and neither I should – but I
									was impressed! It grew into Al becoming a member of the congregation enjoying the
									excellent morning teas and always, I’m told, helping with the wiping up afterwards. More
									locally, he was a regular with Kate and Annette at Pips n Cherries in Bell. Visiting Dalby with
									Al, you find he’s introducing you so many of his friends like Brooksie as you go down the
									street. <br \>
									Then there’s the Jimbour Crew, which is code for Al’s dedicated support group at Jimbour.
									For me the Jimbour Crew started with Jock and Irene Lewis back in the 60s. This was when
									Al moved back to Jimbour from jackarooing out west. They defended and unconditionally
									accepted him through the hard work of becoming an adult. <br \>
									Gino Sandrin worked on Jimbour house with Al for many years. For Al he was always “Gino
									the Italian plasterer”. You’ll see a couple of lovely slides of those times. After Dad died, Gino
									found Al a role as an apprentice in the restoration of the house. He gave Al a certificate for
									all the skills he learned, which has kept pride of place in Al’s bedroom ever since.
									James and Elizabeth Sages, Bob Burwood and Tony Madigan have been great friends. Beer
									o’clock with Tony was the highlight of Al’s day for many years. If Butze Costales came on a
									painting job, it was the first thing Al would tell me on the phone. Butze is currently overseas,
									but we’re glad that his partner Lisa could make it today.
									</p>
									<p>
									A constant through that time has been Karl Graham and more recently Sandra Hanson, both
									very kind, astute and sensitive to Al’s needs. In their complementary ways, they have truely
									loved and cared for him. <br \>
									Smokos – and gardening - would not be the same for Al without the Jimbour Gardens crew.
									He’s one of the crew on their Jimbour Gardens FB page, introduced by them as
									A word from Alec Russell, Pack Controller.
									Al wrote <br \>
									If I get a chance I like mowing the airstrip. Also dead heading the cannas and the daisies. I
									like XXXX gold, but best of all I enjoy our smokos. Come and ask me about the history if you
									see me in the garden. <br \>
									Pack Controller - a good description of Al’s role in our family. Of all his siblings, Al had a
									unique combination of roles - from getting his hands dirty in the Jimbour Gardens or the
									stockyards to the bird’s eye view he had of the Russell properties in his role as pilot, and as
									the custodian of Jimbour House. <br \>
									Al has made an enormous contribution to the family legacy. <br \>
									More than this, Al is the heart of this family and our concerns. He made his life in the
									community of friends and family gathered here today, and I know he opened his heart to
									you as you welcomed him with respect and affection. <br \>
									Thank you Al for all you have achieved, and for how you have brought out the best in people
									all your life.
