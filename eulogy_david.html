									<h1>Alec's Service<br />
									</h1>
									<p>In Loving Memory of Alec Russell<br />.</p>
								</header>
					
								<p>This is not sorrow: this is work. For today we build a memorial
									in words and thoughts for our friend and brother Charles
									Wilfred Alexander Russell – Alec as he was almost universally
									known – who left us at his much loved Jimbour on 19 December
									last.
								</p>

								<p>
									Alec’s great love – reflected in the final page of his Order of
									Service – was flight.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									So it is appropriate that this service, like the funeral service for
									his father Charles, is held here in St John’s Church in Dalby. For
									one of the symbols of St John, reflected in one of the windows
									Alec Anna Ian and I contributed to this Church in his
									grandparents’ and parents’ memory, is the Eagle. It is the King
									of birds: the only bird which can fly directly into the full light of
									the sun, and which flies higher than all others.
								</p>
								<p>
									This church, which played so central a part in Alec's life, was
									named for St John. Alec heard the word of God proclaimed
									from this lectern on countless occasions as part of the parish
									community. As it is in this his final Service.
								</p>
								<p>
									Whilst each of the four windows was dedicated to a particular
									family member for his or her individual characteristics, it is
									remarkable how each of them reflects also an aspect of Alec’s
									life and character.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first, dedicated to Alec’s grandfather, reminds us of the
									parable of the talents. This parable tells us not only the value of
									clear judgment and strategic insight, but also that the true
									measure of a man is not the gifts he is given, but also the
									persistence displayed in developing those gifts, and the integrity
									of purpose applied in doing so.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not applicable to Alec’s grandfather but very much so to Alec
									was the truth that perhaps the greatest of all the talents is to start
									from unpromising beginnings and despite them achieve
									substantially. Those who knew Alec when the photograph at the
									front of the Order of Service was taken, and later when he wrote
									about his dreams in the paper reproduced on the last page, might
									well have been forgiven for thinking his aspirations were
									unlikely to be met. That they were speaks eloquently of the
									courage and persistence Alec applied to this task – a task which
									resulted in 8131 registered flying hours as pilot in command of
									powered flight and over 3,000 gliding flights.
								</p>
								<p>
									The second, dedicated to Alec’s grandmother, references the
									story of Ruth. Ruth’s dedication to her family at great personal
									expense was reflected in Alec’s grandmother’s move to Dalby,
									her assistance to her husband in the restoration of Jimbour, and
									her subsequent devotion to her daughter Joan lasting until her
									death.
								</p>
								<p>
									Upon our father’s death in 1977, it was Alec who remained with
									our mother at Jimbour, providing solace and care until, 20 years
									later, she was compelled to leave for health reasons. But, like
									Ruth, Alec contributed to the great work of the restoration of
									Jimbour both then and after under the watchful eye, and valued
									friendship, of master craftsman Gino Sandrin. Jimbour today is
									testament to the lasting care and devotion Alec applied to that
									task.
								</p>
								<p>
									The third, for Alec’s father, I have already mentioned in the
									context of St John’s association with flight. But St John’s other
									association, again highly relevant for his father but less so for
									Alec, was with the Word and, in that sense, communication.
								</p>
								<p>
									One only needs to look at the photograph at the front of the
									Order of Service to see just how much love Alec transparently
									possessed, and sought to express. Where words were not
									available, gestures and other forms of sharing took their place.
									And despite the frustrations this must from time to time have
									caused, neither Anna, nor Ian, nor I ever heard him complain.
								</p>
									
								<p>
									The fourth window, for Alec’s mother, recalls the third word
									from the Cross, as recounted in St John’s Gospel.
								</p>
								<p>
									This statement is traditionally called "The Word of
									Relationship""; and in it Jesus entrusts Mary , his mother, into the
									care of" the disciple whom Jesus loved “ showing Jesus';
									humanity and the depth of love he had for his mother and the
									disciple into whose care he entrusted her. More generally it
									draws attention to the importance of human relationships, caring
									and responsibility.
								</p>
								<p>
									The size of today’s congregation makes a far better statement of
									the strength of Alec’s relationships than any words of mine
									could accomplish. Mentioning names in such a context
									inevitably carries with it the risk of omission, for which I
									apologise in advance, but the family remembers with particular
									gratitude:
									 Alec’s colleagues in the self-proclaimed “Jimbour crew”;
									 The members of the Darling Downs Soaring Club, who
									had planned shortly to present Alec with a trophy for his
									3000 gliding flights and will now instead display it in
									their club house; and
									 The members of his Christian fellowhip in this parish.
								</p>
								<p>

									Of all the things which defined Alec, in many ways the most
									important to him was his love of flight. He kept his pilot’s log
									books from the very first entry to the last, 3 years ago, at
									Heathrow.
								</p>
								<p>
									Gliding is totally different to powered flight which largely
									nowadays represents a way of getting from point A to point B. I
									have an enduring memory of my flight with Alec above
									McCaffrey’s Field. It was almost eerily silent and seemingly
									unhurried, creating a rare opportunity for reflection and a sense
									of liberation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let us then remember Alec, in his final journey beyond the
									clouds, in the words of John Magee’s High Flight:
									Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,
									And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
									Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
									Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things
									You have not dreamed of --Wheeled and soared and
									swung
									High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there
									I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
									My eager craft through footless halls of air...
									Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
								</p>
									
								<p>
									I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
									Where never lark or even eagle flew --
									And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
									The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
									Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
								</p>
